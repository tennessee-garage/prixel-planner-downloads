Software downloads for the Prixel Planner project

This app lets you plan out block prints using the Prixel Press system (https://prixel.com/).  We are not affiliated with this product, but love it and hope to make it even more enjoyable by allowing rapid experimentation with a virtual Prixel Press.  If you don't have Prixel Press yet, you can get one here: https://prixel.com/products/the-prixel-printing-kit
